# gKreta
Based on Electron, this is a replacement for KRÃ‰TA's web interface.

## Functions
* You can easily select your school. (No need for that klik********* code.)
* A dashboard.
  * You can see statistics about your evaluations, absences... (In the future, much more.)
* All of your evaluations. 
* An organized timetable.
* All of your absences ordered by date.
* A settings panel
* Two languages: English and Hungarian. (Again, in the future I add more.)

## Planned functions
* Notes
* Homeworks (Both student and teacher homeworks)
* Create notes for yourself
* Refreshing data by auth token (for now we store the username and the password, and well, it's not secure)
* In the timetable, switching between weeks.
* ...and much more!
